Keep bouncing on moving platforms to survive
Possibly slime bouncing on logs flowing down a river

No horizontal camera movement 

- [X] Player bounces off walls and ceiling 
- [] Add failure condition, missing platform and hitting ground
    - [] Health? As in limited respawns
- [] Moving platforms across lake bed, varying heights
- [] Get sprites
    - Maybe grab alts for different 'levels'
- [] Add title screen with buttons
- [] Add end screen
- [] Maybe change to using rect collision directly
- [] Score for bounces, maybe a multiplier that resets on non platform bounce/respawn
- [] Pause menu that can quit from?
