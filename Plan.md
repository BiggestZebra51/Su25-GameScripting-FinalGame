Keep bouncing on moving platforms to survive
Possibly slime bouncing on logs flowing down a river

No horizontal camera movement 

- [X] Player bounces off walls and ceiling 
- [X] Add failure condition, missing platform and hitting ground
    - [] Health? As in limited respawns
    - [] Probably throw player with some motion on respawn
- [] Moving platforms across lake bed, varying heights
    - [X] Moving to the side, once off screen clear it
    - Account for spacing of other platforms (probably handled by time)
- [] Get sprites
    - Maybe grab alts for different 'levels'
    - Slime sprites or other round bouncy thingy
    - Background sprites
    - Platform sprites
    - Hud sprites
        - Score tally
        - Menu buttons
- [] Add title screen with buttons
- [] Add end screen
- [] Maybe change to using rect collision directly
- [] Score for bounces, maybe a multiplier that resets on non platform bounce/respawn
- [] Pause menu that can quit from?
